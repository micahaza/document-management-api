Usually we're going to run two tasks

bash$ cd deployer
bash$ ./deployer dmapi:deploy test
bash$ ./deployer dmapi:deploy production

Machine names can be test or production.
For verbose outputs run these commands with -vvv at the end
 ( bash$ ./deployer dmapi:deploy [machinename] -vvv)

1. Deploying to the test machine and run PHPUnit
bash$ ./deployer dmapi:deploy test
NOTE: it will deploy only the LR5 code, it will not run any migration and seed.

2. Deploying to the production machine
bash$ ./deployer dmapi:deploy production

3. Rolling back one revision
bash$ ./deployer rollback [test|production]
NOTE: it will roll back only the PHP code, not the database changes
